# Project Overview

## About This Project
This project is a fictional documentation site created to help a team practice **Git**, **GitHub**, and the **Gitflow workflow** in a collaborative environment.

The focus of this repository is **version control best practices**, not software development. All content is written in Markdown and changes are managed through branches, pull requests, releases, and hotfixes.

---

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to simulate how professional teams collaborate using Gitflow by:

- Working with `main` and `develop` branches
- Creating and merging `feature/*` branches
- Preparing releases using `release/*` branches
- Fixing production issues using `hotfix/*` branches
- Collaborating through pull requests and code reviews

---

## What This Project Includes
This documentation site contains:

- General project information
- Setup and installation instructions
- A changelog tracking releases and hotfixes
- Versioned releases published on GitHub

All files are maintained using Gitflow rules to ensure clean and traceable history.

---

## Workflow Summary
The team follows the Gitflow model:

- **main**: Production-ready documentation
- **develop**: Integration branch for features
- **feature/***: New documentation changes
- **release/***: Preparation for official releases
- **hotfix/***: Urgent fixes to production content

No direct commits are allowed on the `main` branch.

---

## Target Audience
This project is intended for:

- Students learning Git and GitHub
- Teams practicing collaborative workflows
- Anyone new to Gitflow who wants a hands-on example

---

## Learning Outcomes
By working on this project, contributors will gain experience in:

- Branching strategies
- Pull request reviews
- Release management
- Hotfix handling
- Team collaboration using GitHub

## Disclaimer
This is a **practice project**. The content is intentionally simple and exists only to support learning Git workflows.
